Article: Securing Web Applications with Node.js: A Guide to Implementing Best Practices
Web applications have become an integral part of businesses and users alike, offering convenience and efficiency in a digital-first world. However, with increasing web traffic, the risk of cyber threats has surged as well. Developers need to ensure that their web applications are secure from vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and data breaches. In this article, I’ll discuss best practices for securing a web application built using Node.js, one of the most popular JavaScript runtimes.

Why Node.js for Web Applications?
Node.js has revolutionized the development landscape with its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for building scalable applications. Its ease of use, speed, and a vast library of open-source packages through npm (Node Package Manager) make it a go-to choice for developers. However, this convenience can also expose applications to security risks if not handled properly.

1. Input Validation
One of the most critical elements in securing a web application is validating user input. Improper input validation can lead to common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting. In Node.js, the following methods can ensure data is…
